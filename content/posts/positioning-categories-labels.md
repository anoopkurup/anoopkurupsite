Lawyer, Doctor, Accountant, Carpenter, plumber, electrician, mason.

We know what these labels mean. 

We know what these professions do, or are supposed to do.

**Aren't socially accepted labels enough to identify professions and businesses?**

Not really, we do categories professions. 
A doctor is not just a doctor. A doctor is a general practitioner, cardiologist, neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, etc..

We do categorise. For convenience and ease of identifying the expert who can solve our problem.

From the perspective of an expert, even with the specialisation, they are still part of a large crowd of professional. Struggling to stand out and make a mark. And more importantly, struggling to attract more clients.

Positioning helps here. 
Positioning helps experts stand out from the crowd and be identified for their niche. 

A lawyer, a corporate lawyer, when positioned well becomes someone who can "protect the interest of investors in funding rounds".  Positioning them as a specialist that startup investors can approach and rely up on.

**Positioning is not about labels, or categories. It is about the problem an expert solves for a target group of clients.**
