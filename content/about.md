Hi, I am Anoop Kurup.

I live in Bangalore, India.

## Authority Builder
Authority building is a mix of positioning, service design, messaging, cold lead generation, and content marketing. 

## I work with
I specialise in helping experts in Financial advisory, Intellectual property rights, Chartered accountants, corporate lawyers, and founders of technology companies. 

## What I do for you
Experts are great at what they do. 

Not so good at telling the world what they do.

Over the years I have discovered ways to position experts as an authority and get them the visibility they deserve. In turn it attracts the attention of potential clients. 

Getting them more clients, faster.

## My journey so far
I started my career in 2005 as a Plastics Research Engineer (chemical engineering) in GE. Then moved to GE Global Research to work on Advance Technology projects. In 2009, I started my first company offering IPR services to Indian Startups. After the company was acquired in 2015, I became a marketing consultant.

Over the years I learnt various aspects of marketing strategy and digital marketing. These experiences led to creating a unique positioning as an Authority Builder.
